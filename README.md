Everyone, make sure you are on the `preview` branch before doing anything!

~~~bash
$ git checkout preview
~~~

To preview the blog, install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), 
and then [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/):

~~~bash
$ gem install jekyll
~~~

and then within the root of the project:

~~~bash
$ jekyll serve
~~~

and go to `http://localhost:4000`.
